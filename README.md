# Blood-Bank-Management-System
_Java based Desktop Application for Blood Bank Management System_

This project is based on blood bank management system. It will help in keeping and tracking records for blood samples collected from donor at a medical and 
store the blood in blood bank. Conventional Model of keeping physical directory in blood bank suffers from several issues such as human effort, human errors, access time, and 
less reliability. For overcoming the hassles related to conventional blood bank directory, our proposed system aims to solve these problems for minimizing the manual work for 
Blood Bank by providing better record management efficiency with ever increasing records. In the current pandemic situation, we are focusing on segregating the data of Blood Donors 
based on their Covid History which will help the patients to get their samples according to the priority and convenience.
